# Tableau-Tables-and-Dashboards
Tableau Repository designed to reflect Tableau visualisation software capabilities on the Global Video Gaming Dataset

The dataset contains 12,442 records (rows) with 10 attributes (columns) so can be considered as small. Although my main specialty is based around Microsoft PowerBI in this project I aimed to illustrate the intuitive and often superior interface nature of Tableau.

Visualisations quality appears to have a better design, and take less lead time to be created over the larger datasets.
